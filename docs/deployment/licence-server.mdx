## Server write access

**Step 1:** Open the CodeMeter Control Centre from your system tray

**Step 3:** Go to Configuration -> Basic -> WebAdmin. Change the settings to match below. Please email <Obfuscate email="support@mxrap.com" /> with the password (we suggest something easy to remember). Then press apply.
