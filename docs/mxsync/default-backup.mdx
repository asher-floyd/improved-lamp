The mXrap team will often ask you to perform a "default backup" when providing support, or if you're adding new apps. This allows us to work on your root in the same state you're using it in, so any settings or customisations are visible to us. It is good practice to do default backups regularly, as it makes it easier to identify or roll back any breaking changes.

The mXsync button at the bottom left of every mXrap window will blink to remind users to backup every 4 weeks.

## Performing a default backup

mXsync will have been installed alongside mXrap. The installer will have created a Start Menu item named "mXsync". Open it.

### Logging in

Once mXsync is open, check that you're logged in. If you're logged in, you will see your username at the top of the program. If you're not logged in, go to `User -> Login` and enter your username and password. If you don't know your mXsync username and password, please contact support.

### Finding your root folder

If you can see your root folder in the left-hand pane, skip to the next step.

If not, click on `Projects -> Add an Existing Project Folder to list`, then browse to the location of the site root folder. The root folder should now appear in the list on the left.

:::warning

Be careful that there is only ONE copy of the root folder on your systems. Do not accidentally choose an old copy of the root folder. It can cause all sorts of confusion.

:::

### Do Default Backup

Select your root folder then click the `Enable Project` button on the right hand side.

Press the `Do Default Backup` button on the right. Once the Backup is complete, you can press `Close` and Close mXsync. If you get a message about the upload still going, make sure you select `Let it finish`.
