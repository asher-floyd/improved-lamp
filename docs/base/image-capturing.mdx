You can capture or save any 3D view, chart or table using the 'Clip' or 'File' options at the top-right of the mXrap window. There are additional image capturing controls available to increase the quality and to adjust what is captured in the image.

For capturing charts for example, you can turn on/off the header/footer, axis titles, axis ticks or grid lines. In table views, you can capture as an image or csv file, all rows or selected, with or without column headers. High quality images can be really handy for reports, papers or website publishing.
