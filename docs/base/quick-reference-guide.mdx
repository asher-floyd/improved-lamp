Most users are probably aware of the Quick Reference Guide in the Cheat Sheets. It lists all the mXrap shortcuts and hotkeys but it is spread over a few pages and can be a bit tough to find what you're looking for. Below is a one-page Quick Reference Guide for more of a visual lookup of the main controls. The controls for the new Annotations tool are not included but help for those controls is available in mXrap itself. Here is the [PDF version](/img/pdf/Quick-Reference-Guide.pdf) of the one-page guide if you want to print a copy.
