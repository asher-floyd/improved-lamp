## How to use Workspaces

Workspaces are available in every app and are used to save your current settings to be quickly used again at a later date. They are very handy to communicate things you've noticed to other members of your team or even to send errors you've notices to ACG.

Keep in mind that workspaces were introduced originally meant to be used only in the short term. We cannot always support workspaces through root upgrades so you might lose workspaces from time-to-time. Try not to rely on them in the long-term or be prepared to occasionally have to recreate them.

Hello,
this is Alex and welcome to another mXrap tutorial.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.212
In this tutorial,
we'll be looking at using the workspace

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:10.440
function to save your current view.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.400
So we can do this on any 3D view,
table view or chart.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.360
But for the purpose of this,
I'm going to use a chart.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.624
We'll use the magnitude time chart and
then we'll go and apply some random

4cabe213-35ce-4a4e-9310-2e48e7b52f24-1
00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:22.160
filters.

18b8baac-861a-4dd5-9391-0cfcd5ea9407-0
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.360
So I say I put a range filter on for a
minimum of 0.

171a8d0b-2936-4337-b882-1638e0e37380-0
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.571
I want to turn off the trend line for the
cumulative number of events,

171a8d0b-2936-4337-b882-1638e0e37380-1
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:33.316
and I want to leave now for whatever
reason,

171a8d0b-2936-4337-b882-1638e0e37380-2
00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:36.000
but I want to revisit this workspace
later.

c77803f3-7634-4fb0-8095-210b2793c510-0
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.858
I go up to the top left,
next to the Settings drop down,

c77803f3-7634-4fb0-8095-210b2793c510-1
00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:41.200
there's a Workspaces tab.

7c3bea2d-20ce-41b9-aeee-0021a3b3575f-0
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.000
We click that one and we press Save
Current as Workspace.

f4208f6c-4622-4f02-835f-d7224b09f819-0
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.843
Now you can either choose an existing one,
but that'll override it,

f4208f6c-4622-4f02-835f-d7224b09f819-1
00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:53.080
or you can add a new one.

33befa1e-7b93-4c81-a2c0-1fa71817f373-0
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.440
So we'll call this one Training.

8b32a039-bc6d-4375-b2cb-ca0fcf5753fe-0
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.124
We'll call it Training0 and then you can
see it's popped up down there,

8b32a039-bc6d-4375-b2cb-ca0fcf5753fe-1
00:01:00.124 --> 00:01:00.880
so it's saved.

8c0128fd-524d-41a6-b4a9-ceca009f383f-0
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.429
You can close General Analysis ,
and then when we go back to the Apps

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:11.207
window,
we can click on General Analysis and we

00:01:11.207 --> 00:01:14.120
see Training0 on the right hand side.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.102
So if we double click,
that General Analysis will open up and we

00:01:20.102 --> 00:01:24.200
should be taken back to the view that we
saved on.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.440
And there we go, that's it for this video.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.440
I hope you've enjoyed it.
