Grids are a dynamic tool used throughout mXrap to form seismic populations, perform calculations and display results.

Taking time to set-up site appropriate grids not only makes performing analysis in mXrap more efficient, but it enables others to easily replicate your results. Most sites benefit from a mine and/or orebody wide coarse (sparse) and relatively dense grid, plus additional higher resolution (dense) grids for areas of interest.

In the example below there are two mine wide grids with different spacings (20 m and 100 m) and several higher resolution grids for select areas with spacings of 5 m and 10 m.

Very small and sparse grids load quickly but are typically low resolution making meaningful interpretation challenging.

Very large and dense grids require a lot of computing power and can take a long time to calculate, but are much more likely to facilitate meaningful analysis.

If your grid is too big and/or dense, it may result in a 'Blocked' message. If this happens, increase the grid spacing or reduce the grid size to return mXrap to 'Ready'.

## Edit Grids

To add, change and delete grids, navigate to the 'General Setup Windows' tab across the top of your mXrap app. Open the 'Grid Editor' tab and tick on the 'Edit' option of the Grids table.

Using the Edit dropdown, you can add a new row or delete selected rows. When you add or change grid settings, you need to save the changes by clicking the blue floppy disk located in the top left. If the floppy is greyed out, there are currently no changes that need to be saved.

Using the 'Grid Controls' panel, you can override the configuration of preconfigured grids.

This is an excellent way to investigate the impacts of changing the grid spatial extents or spacing prior to adding and saving a new grid for frequent use.
