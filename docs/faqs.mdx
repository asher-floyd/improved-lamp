## General

### What does mXrap stand for?

The name of mXrap's predecessor "MS-RAP" stood for **M**ine **S**eismicity **R**isk **A**nalysis **P**rogram. "mXrap", however, is not an acronym and does not stand for anything.

### What is the difference between mXrap, mXrap suites, and mXrap apps?

This is best answered by way of analogy with Microsoft Excel. The software Excel has many built-in capabilities with endless possibilities for creating specific calculations. Excel has powerful capabilities, but without a user constructing the spreadsheet, the power and value are not fully utilised. An Excel user can set up a spreadsheet which, with the required inputs, will provide you with results. This user can then provide you with that spreadsheet, which you can then use to perform the same calculations with other inputs.

mXrap is like Excel in that it provides the basic tools. mXrap suites are analagous to Excel workbooks with many sheets, and the apps are like the individual sheets within that workbook used to perform specific tasks. Anybody with enough understanding of the software can build their own app which can be shared with others.

### What is the "root" folder?

One can think of the root folder as a library of apps and data. Extending the analogy with Excel, the root folder is like a folder with several previously developed linked spreadsheets which you can open to perform specific types of analyses.
