The quickest way to get help is by email at <Obfuscate email="support@mxrap.com" />.

The more information we have, the quicker we can solve any issues. Including the following details will help us out:

- Your root name, usually visible at the bottom left of mXrap in the format `root_SiteName`
- The version of mXrap you are using
- Your seismic provider
- The app(s) you need help with
- A screenshot of the issue

If you're able to [perform a default backup](docs/mxsync/default-backup) on your root, please do so.

## Remote access

Our preferred remote support platform is **Microsoft Teams**.

If site IT has disabled remote access via Teams, we are also able to help using TeamViewer. To enable us to connect to you, you either need to install the [full version of Teamviewer](https://download.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewer_Setup.exe) or simply download and run the [mXrap QuickSupport](https://get.teamviewer.com/6kh4ebw) version (no admin privileges needed).

[Teamviewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx) for more information.
