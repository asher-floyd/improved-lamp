The Damage Mapping app is designed to allow users to damage map their underground excavations using a tablet device while offline. The browser-based app gives users simple, consistent, easy-to-use inputs to collect damage data, along with data associated with damage (installed ground support, ground conditions, etc). The data is then imported into mXrap for further visualisation and analysis.
