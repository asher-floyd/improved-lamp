# <FaMountain /> Surface Monitoring

The Prism Monitoring app provides the tools to import and evaluate
prism data which is routinely used to monitor ground movements, for
example, slopes in open pits, underground drives or subsidence zones
associated with caving. Displacement and rate data are plotted in 3D
as a vector and interpolated values on triangulations, charted over
time, and summarised in tables. Data from the period of interest can
be selected for individual, multiple, or predefined zones of prisms.
Additional analysis options include piecewise linear fitting to assess
rates of deformation and persistent quality tags for excluding
erroneous data.
