## Caving Sandbox

The Caving Sandbox brings together multiple forms of cave monitoring in order to give users the best possible picture of what is happening in their cave mine.

The app also includes several other charts and tables to help quantify production versus seismicity and the height of the cave back over time. The monitoring methods included in the app are:

- Seismic monitoring
- Smart makers and Networked Smart Markers
- Elexon Cave Tracker beacons
- Open hole dipping
- Extensometers
- Production columns (a projection of the height of draw/cave based on the tonnes drawn from each drawpoint/ring)
- Borehole logging
- Active seismic tomorgraphy
- Fibre optic cable monitoring
- Blasts
- Surface subsidence calculations (automatically calculated displacement between two surface flyovers)

## Fragmentation

This app analyses and displays caving fragmentation data. The particle size distributions for different drawpoints for different dates can be viewed. Chosen particle size percentile values can be displayed in 3D for different dates and as a column representing the change over time. Pie charts for each drawpoint can be shown in 3D showing the proportion of each size category of the fragmentation. A heatmap of fragmentation can also be plotted in 3D.

## Caving hydraulic radius

Using the undercut blasting data, this app calculates the hydraulic radius (HR) of the undercut over time. The app provides functions to correlate the seismic response with the hydraulic radius.
