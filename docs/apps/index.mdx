mXrap is a geotechnical analysis software platform in which suites of apps can be developed. The [ACG team](/team) and some of our users develop their own apps.

The suites available in mXrap can be broadly summarised under the following areas of interest:

The following research projects are using mXrap as a technology transfer tool and apps will be developed under the research project for both internal use and for transferring the research outcomes to sponsor sites as useful software:

- [Ground Support Systems Optimisation](https://gsso.com.au/)
- [Stope Reconciliation](https://acg.uwa.edu.au/stope-design-phase-2/)

Many of these apps have been developed over several years, with a number of them having roots in the ACG's [Mine Seismicity and Rockburst Risk Management project](https://acg.uwa.edu.au/mine-seismicity-and-rockburst-risk-management-project/).
