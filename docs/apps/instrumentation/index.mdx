# <FaRulerCombined /> Instrumentation

## Extensometers

This app provides the tools to import and evaluate various formats of extensometer data.Data is assessed over the life of the instrument and for a period of interest.Displacement is expressed as a cumulative value over the instrument length and per node values.Instruments are plotted in 3D with markers displaying displacement measurement along with nearby seismic events and blasts.Cumulative and per node displacement values are charted over time and summarised in tables.

## In Situ Stress Monitoring

**Description:** Continual monitoring of in situ stress is done by installing stress measurement devices like the CSIRO stress cell, or vibrating wire stress cell, and monitoring the measured changes over time.This app receives the strain measurement recorded by the stress measurement device and inverts for the in situ stress state.This allows for the analysis of changes in stress magnitude and orientation over time.
