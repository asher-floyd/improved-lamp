# <FaAnglesDown /> Stope Reconciliation

The Stope Reconciliation suite allows users to reconcile their mined surveys and design shapes quickly and easily. The reconciliation analysis is done on a fine resolution (less than 1 m) which allows for insights on a scale not previously considered in the industry. The app considers a range of factors which can contribute to stope performance, for example, quantification of various aspects of design geometry, blasthole data, and geotechnical data. The analysis application gives users the ability to visualise and discover trends in their data, identifying the critical factors leading to stope overbreak and underbreak at their mine. The prediction add-on module provides insight into the expected mined geometry for understanding and optimising the stope performance. Predictions are made at a fine resolution (less than 1 m) allowing to build a predicted mined geometry and reconcile with the design shape and economic block model in order to determine the overbreak, underbreak, and economic performance.
