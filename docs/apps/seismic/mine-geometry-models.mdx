Stope, cave and development geometry is a fundamental aspect of most geotechnical analysis. Mine geometry also varies over time and capturing these changes is critical in any back analysis or numerical modelling that investigates stability or monitoring parameters over time. This is a utility app to create models of mine geometry that can be exported to facilitate a wide range of applications such as:

- **Live surveys** -- Mine geometry can be displayed as surfaces in General Analysis and other 3D views that automatically update with the current time filters. So when you backdate your seismicity to a year ago, the surveys will only show geometry present at the time.
- **Volume calculations** -- Mining volume can be calculated over time. This allows seismicity and other parameters to be plotted as a function of mine geometry.
- **Distance calculations** -- It is often important to know the distance of large events or damage locations to the nearest development or stope at the relevant time. This is like the distance to survey tool except time is also taken into account. So you can compute the closest stope at the time of damage or the closest development at the time of the large event.
- **Numerical modelling inputs** -- The geometry models can be exported in a number of formats, including Map3D .inp format.

The export options will gradually be expanded to more modelling formats such as FLAC, RS3 and Wave. Another possible application is to create block models of lithology or geotechnical domains based on lithology contact wireframes.

Training videos have been made to walkthrough the new app. See the [training videos here](https://www.mxrap.com/mxvideos/link/14).
