A simple utility app has been added to the main root that can be used to export surveys loaded in mXrap. Possible reasons to use this app include:

- Switch between file formats
- Export a decimated survey
- Export a survey with translated or swapped coordinates
- Combine multiple surveys into a single file

Currently supported export formats are:

- `DXF`
- `DTM / STR`
- `PNT`
- `STL`
