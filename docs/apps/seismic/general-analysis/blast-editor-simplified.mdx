Laura here with the mXrap team.
This video covers the Blast Editor.
Today we're going to be looking at the
Blast Editor in the General Analysis app,
but you do have access to it through the
General Setup windows of a variety of
![Screenshot 00:00:09.196](tutorial-img/00-00-09-196.png)
different apps.
When you come into these windows,
you find the Blast Editor and you'll see
![Screenshot 00:00:14.560](tutorial-img/00-00-14-560.png)
on the right hand side you have a 3D View
with the last blast highlighted in green
and the second last blast highlighted in
pink.
And on the left hand side,
you have two tables.
So 1 is your unfiltered Blast editor,
and the other is filtered.
![Screenshot 00:00:29.368](tutorial-img/00-00-29-368.png)
So if I come here and I enable my tons
filter, for example,
![Screenshot 00:00:33.880](tutorial-img/00-00-33-880.png)
you'll see that I'm filtering here,
but I don't see any impacts of that
![Screenshot 00:00:38.101](tutorial-img/00-00-38-101.png)
filter on the unfiltered Blast Editor.
![Screenshot 00:00:43.166](tutorial-img/00-00-43-166.png)
So I'll just turn that off.
![Screenshot 00:00:47.120](tutorial-img/00-00-47-120.png)
Let's say we want to add a new Blast here.
We're going to come to the top right,
tick this on to enable editing and insert
a new row here.
We can type in the date XY and Z.
That's all that's required.
Any of these other columns is used for
your own information,
![Screenshot 00:01:02.840](tutorial-img/00-01-02-840.png)
for filtering and things like that,
but at a minimum,
![Screenshot 00:01:06.534](tutorial-img/00-01-06-534.png)
you need a date XY and Z.
![Screenshot 00:01:09.805](tutorial-img/00-01-09-805.png)
So if I just copy this in and I say let's
make this 2014, you'll see that
![Screenshot 00:01:12.680](tutorial-img/00-01-12-680.png)
now this is my last blast,
shown here in green.
Right here again,
we've moved it up by just changing this
location.
It was previously covering the second
last blast.
![Screenshot 00:01:36.680](tutorial-img/00-01-36-680.png)
You can also see on the left hand side
here, it will give you warnings.
So in this case,
it's telling us that we have a duplicated
blast in space and time.
So if I just sort by my date time and go
down to see which of these is highlighted
in orange, here I have my duplicates.
Obviously I only need one of those in my
data set.
![Screenshot 00:01:54.800](tutorial-img/00-01-54-800.png)
So I'm going to go ahead and highlight
this,
come up to edit and delete my Yellow
selected row.
![Screenshot 00:02:00.195](tutorial-img/00-02-00-195.png)
Now I don't have any duplicates.
![Screenshot 00:02:04.160](tutorial-img/00-02-04-160.png)
I do have one blast that a time or
location has not been entered for,
![Screenshot 00:02:06.360](tutorial-img/00-02-06-360.png)
so I could go in and clean that up as
well.
![Screenshot 00:02:10.117](tutorial-img/00-02-10-117.png)
Your other option for editing blasts is
to do it in the back end in the CSV.
![Screenshot 00:02:13.960](tutorial-img/00-02-13-960.png)
So if you go to your apps window,
you browse your root,
![Screenshot 00:02:19.200](tutorial-img/00-02-19-200.png)
you find where your blasts are stored.
![Screenshot 00:02:23.346](tutorial-img/00-02-23-346.png)
So that's typically Standard Data, Blasts.
You can see that you have your blast CSV
here.
![Screenshot 00:02:29.440](tutorial-img/00-02-29-440.png)
I go ahead and open that up.
Whenever it's opened up in Excel,
the date column is going to be
reformatted.
This is a problem because if you add a
bunch of new blast now and you save this,
it is going to be blocked and not read
back into mXrap properly.
So anytime you open up this file,
you have to reformat this column so you
can highlight that column.
Come here.
![Screenshot 00:02:57.680](tutorial-img/00-02-57-680.png)
More Number Formats and you need to do a
custom format.
So that's going to be yyyy-MM-dd space.
hh:mm:ss.0 OK,
so unless you have a very specific custom
format for your mine,
this is going to be the one that you need
![Screenshot 00:03:15.215](tutorial-img/00-03-15-215.png)
to use.
So I hit OK, I hit save,
then when I go back to mXrap,
if I had made changes,
I would reload the data and I would see
![Screenshot 00:03:26.673](tutorial-img/00-03-26-673.png)
those new blasts come in.

Editor, as always,
