This video covers the Blast Editor.
![Screenshot 00:00:02.120](./tutorial-img/00-00-02-120.png)
Today we're going to be looking at the
Blast Editor in the General Analysis app,
![Screenshot 00:00:05.160](./tutorial-img/00-00-05-160.png)
but you do have access to it through the
General Setup windows of a variety of
![Screenshot 00:00:09.196](./tutorial-img/00-00-09-196.png)
different apps.
![Screenshot 00:00:13.132](./tutorial-img/00-00-13-132.png)
When you come into these windows,
you find the Blast Editor and you'll see
![Screenshot 00:00:14.560](./tutorial-img/00-00-14-560.png)
on the right hand side you have a 3D View
with the last blast highlighted in green
![Screenshot 00:00:18.760](./tutorial-img/00-00-18-760.png)
and the second last blast highlighted in
pink.
![Screenshot 00:00:23.408](./tutorial-img/00-00-23-408.png)
And on the left hand side,
you have two tables.
![Screenshot 00:00:26.480](./tutorial-img/00-00-26-480.png)
So 1 is your unfiltered Blast editor,
and the other is filtered.
![Screenshot 00:00:29.368](./tutorial-img/00-00-29-368.png)
So if I come here and I enable my tons
filter, for example,
![Screenshot 00:00:33.880](./tutorial-img/00-00-33-880.png)
you'll see that I'm filtering here,
but I don't see any impacts of that
![Screenshot 00:00:38.101](./tutorial-img/00-00-38-101.png)
filter on the unfiltered Blast Editor.
![Screenshot 00:00:43.166](./tutorial-img/00-00-43-166.png)
So I'll just turn that off.
![Screenshot 00:00:47.120](./tutorial-img/00-00-47-120.png)
Let's say we want to add a new Blast here.
![Screenshot 00:00:49.000](./tutorial-img/00-00-49-000.png)
We're going to come to the top right,
tick this on to enable editing and insert
![Screenshot 00:00:51.680](./tutorial-img/00-00-51-680.png)
a new row here.
![Screenshot 00:00:57.271](./tutorial-img/00-00-57-271.png)
We can type in the date XY and Z.
![Screenshot 00:00:58.320](./tutorial-img/00-00-58-320.png)
That's all that's required.
![Screenshot 00:01:01.320](./tutorial-img/00-01-01-320.png)
Any of these other columns is used for
your own information,
![Screenshot 00:01:02.840](./tutorial-img/00-01-02-840.png)
for filtering and things like that,
but at a minimum,
![Screenshot 00:01:06.534](./tutorial-img/00-01-06-534.png)
you need a date XY and Z.
![Screenshot 00:01:09.805](./tutorial-img/00-01-09-805.png)
So if I just copy this in and I say let's
make this 2014, you'll see that
![Screenshot 00:01:12.680](./tutorial-img/00-01-12-680.png)
now this is my last blast,
shown here in green.
![Screenshot 00:01:22.040](./tutorial-img/00-01-22-040.png)
Right here again,
we've moved it up by just changing this
![Screenshot 00:01:33.000](./tutorial-img/00-01-33-000.png)
location.
![Screenshot 00:01:36.185](./tutorial-img/00-01-36-185.png)
It was previously covering the second
last blast.
![Screenshot 00:01:36.680](./tutorial-img/00-01-36-680.png)
You can also see on the left hand side
here, it will give you warnings.
![Screenshot 00:01:39.840](./tutorial-img/00-01-39-840.png)
So in this case,
it's telling us that we have a duplicated
![Screenshot 00:01:43.400](./tutorial-img/00-01-43-400.png)
blast in space and time.
![Screenshot 00:01:46.214](./tutorial-img/00-01-46-214.png)
So if I just sort by my date time and go
down to see which of these is highlighted
![Screenshot 00:01:47.880](./tutorial-img/00-01-47-880.png)
in orange, here I have my duplicates.
![Screenshot 00:01:52.389](./tutorial-img/00-01-52-389.png)
Obviously I only need one of those in my
data set.
![Screenshot 00:01:54.800](./tutorial-img/00-01-54-800.png)
So I'm going to go ahead and highlight
this,
![Screenshot 00:01:57.720](./tutorial-img/00-01-57-720.png)
come up to edit and delete my Yellow
selected row.
![Screenshot 00:02:00.195](./tutorial-img/00-02-00-195.png)
Now I don't have any duplicates.
![Screenshot 00:02:04.160](./tutorial-img/00-02-04-160.png)
I do have one blast that a time or
location has not been entered for,
![Screenshot 00:02:06.360](./tutorial-img/00-02-06-360.png)
so I could go in and clean that up as
well.
![Screenshot 00:02:10.117](./tutorial-img/00-02-10-117.png)
Your other option for editing blasts is
to do it in the back end in the CSV.
![Screenshot 00:02:13.960](./tutorial-img/00-02-13-960.png)
So if you go to your apps window,
you browse your root,
![Screenshot 00:02:19.200](./tutorial-img/00-02-19-200.png)
you find where your blasts are stored.
![Screenshot 00:02:23.346](./tutorial-img/00-02-23-346.png)
So that's typically Standard Data, Blasts.
![Screenshot 00:02:26.160](./tutorial-img/00-02-26-160.png)
You can see that you have your blast CSV
here.
![Screenshot 00:02:29.440](./tutorial-img/00-02-29-440.png)
I go ahead and open that up.
![Screenshot 00:02:34.600](./tutorial-img/00-02-34-600.png)
Whenever it's opened up in Excel,
the date column is going to be
![Screenshot 00:02:36.440](./tutorial-img/00-02-36-440.png)
reformatted.
![Screenshot 00:02:40.964](./tutorial-img/00-02-40-964.png)
This is a problem because if you add a
bunch of new blast now and you save this,
![Screenshot 00:02:42.440](./tutorial-img/00-02-42-440.png)
it is going to be blocked and not read
back into mXrap properly.
![Screenshot 00:02:46.856](./tutorial-img/00-02-46-856.png)
So anytime you open up this file,
you have to reformat this column so you
![Screenshot 00:02:50.800](./tutorial-img/00-02-50-800.png)
can highlight that column.
![Screenshot 00:02:55.506](./tutorial-img/00-02-55-506.png)
Come here.
![Screenshot 00:02:57.680](./tutorial-img/00-02-57-680.png)
More Number Formats and you need to do a
custom format.
![Screenshot 00:02:58.720](./tutorial-img/00-02-58-720.png)
So that's going to be yyyy-MM-dd space.
![Screenshot 00:03:02.560](./tutorial-img/00-03-02-560.png)
hh:mm:ss.0 OK,
so unless you have a very specific custom
![Screenshot 00:03:09.640](./tutorial-img/00-03-09-640.png)
format for your mine,
this is going to be the one that you need
![Screenshot 00:03:15.215](./tutorial-img/00-03-15-215.png)
to use.
![Screenshot 00:03:21.475](./tutorial-img/00-03-21-475.png)
So I hit OK, I hit save,
then when I go back to mXrap,
![Screenshot 00:03:22.520](./tutorial-img/00-03-22-520.png)
if I had made changes,
I would reload the data and I would see
![Screenshot 00:03:26.673](./tutorial-img/00-03-26-673.png)
those new blasts come in.
![Screenshot 00:03:31.431](./tutorial-img/00-03-31-431.png)
If you have any other questions or
require further guidance with respect to
![Screenshot 00:03:34.600](./tutorial-img/00-03-34-600.png)
your BLAST database and using the BLAST
Editor, as always,
![Screenshot 00:03:38.819](./tutorial-img/00-03-38-819.png)
