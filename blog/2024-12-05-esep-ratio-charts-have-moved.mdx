Similar to above, the Es:Ep ratio chart for VSA's (previously found under VSA > Charts) is now found in the VSA Parameter Distributions.

**\*Note: You will need to recreate any workspaces that include the old Es:Ep ratio charts. Simply replace the old chart with the new parameter distribution chart set to the EsEp option.**
