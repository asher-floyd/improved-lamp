You can now measure distances in any 3D view in mXrap (version 5.6.0 or later) with the ruler tool in the Annotations tab. The ["Annotations tool" training video](https://www.mxrap.com/mxvideos/link/13) goes through all the features and the operation. Most operations will probably be for the distance between two points, such as the event-to-survey distance below. You can also extend this to a multi-point ruler for measuring more complicated paths.

The controls are very similar to selection boxes. Control instructions are in the Annotations tab.

- Ctrl + Left-click to move/select point
- Ctrl + Right-click to rotate/cancel
- Space to insert a point
- Del to delete point

Other features include:

- Snap ruler to point or surface (crosshairs will turn from red to green when snapping)
- Point rounding - For selecting points on a grid or post-rounding
- User defined labels on vertices or segments
- Table of point coordinates, segment lengths, horizontal and vertical runs, trend and plunge
- Optional arrow head
- Save and load rulers
- Flatten points to the focal plane (view plane)
