Moment tensors have been added to the General Analysis application in the recent update. Beach balls and principal axes can be viewed in the General Analysis 3D view. There is also a separate Moment Tensor window with a number of stereonets and mechanism charts. Two new training videos have been uploaded to the [General Analysis (3D View) page](https://www.mxrap.com/mxvideos/link/20) that walkthrough the new tools.

IMS and ESG sites should have moment tensors loaded in with the events table automatically.
