The isosurfaces for b-value have been upgraded in the latest root. There is now much more control over the isosurface levels. Up to 5 iso's can be plotted for user defined ranges.

A linguistic name can be assigned to each level and displayed in the legend. A new video has been uploaded to the [Hazard Assessment page](https://mxrap.com/2019/01/12/hazard-assessment-app-excavation-view/) that explains the new b-value isosurfaces.
