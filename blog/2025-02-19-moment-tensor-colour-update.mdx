For users that look at moment tensors, please be aware that we are changing the arrow colours and improving the legend.

{/* truncate */}

The colours of the moment tensor T and P axes have been updated to align with the colours used in ESG and IMS system:

- Red for the P axis
- Blue for the T axis

The legend for the moment tensors now has nice labels to allow you to identify the axes, planes and motions.

You can see this change in the comparison below.
