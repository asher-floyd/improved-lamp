## What's new for Developers - mXrap 6.0.6

## Developers

Release Date: 26 September 2024

### Tableview / Action

- Ensure numbers are exported with the requested precision (was exporting with full precision always).

### Tablecalc

- Improved speed for unfiltered and unsorted input tables.
- Improved speed for cancelling Tablecalcs during startup.
- Allow access to more memory (at the cost of some speed).
- HeapStats builtin now can give you more information about the system's RAM.
- Can extend some types of memory limits with a call inside Tablecalc to the HeapStats builtin (contact support for information).

### Tablecalc FileIO

- Introduced `FileIO.File.fopen_create_must_not_exist()`  
  Use this when you want to guarantee that the file you are creating did not already exist.

### HTML View

- Don't cache resources / images - helps to reload the content when (eg) reports are updated.
- Allow resources to be loaded from within bundles.

### System Information

- SystemMonitor tool now has Total Physical RAM value.

### Bug Fixes

- Allow a bundled Import-CSV's preview to see its own content.
- Fix behaviour of Configure Dialogs for Chart and View3d in the Analysis Window (would sometimes get melted into the main window).

- When saving Tools in Settings Window:

- Don't scan special folders such as "CON" and "NUL" (these names are reserved in Windows).

- Populate the list of existing files in a folder.

### Other recent changes of note:

- ML Rating and b-value Isos are exposed from the Grid Based Analysis bundle.
- Windows that use '!/Grid Based Analysis/@public/Coarse Grid Picks' and Selections now point to '!/Grid Based Analysis/@public/Grid Table Picks and Selections'.
- mx_js updates:
  - `exportDXF` supports RGB / transparency / multiple mesh entities per layer
  - added `polybool.js`, `base64.js`, `error_checking.js`, `sgm_equations.js`, `octree.js`, `quickhull3d`, `stoer-wagner min cut`, `volume-slicing.js`, `mcmc.js`, `jDBSCAN.js`
- Changes to HTML
  - To improve compatibility with relative paths do not use `file://Folder/File` Instead use `file:Folder/File`

- Cleaned up unused tools in ! folder. Please let us know if anything breaks.
- JS memory limits improved (6.0.6).
- Modified Strong Ground Motion calibration equations and standardised to use the `sgm_equations.js` library.
- Added a data anomaly detection and filter tool for S:P Energy and Corner Frequency. Any existing references to these parameters in site specific quality filters may cause issues.
- Removed max energy and max moment from quality filter.
