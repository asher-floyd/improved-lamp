The distance to survey filter has been around for a while but now we have added a couple of new charts to further investigate the relationship between seismicity and your input surveys. The charts have been added to the General Analysis application, under the Charts menu - look for Distance to Surveys.

There is a training video to explain a few things about the charts, find it [here](https://www.mxrap.com/mxvideos/link/9).

The example below shows how you can compare your seismicity around your geological structures. Of course, sometimes a structure will have a lot of seismicity nearby because you happen to do a lot of blasting nearby. You can also plot blasts as a function of distance to survey!

If you can't see the charts in your mXrap, you might need a quick root update. Ping us an email at our support email address. and we'll sort it out. Now we've set up everyone with mXsync, updates are very easy, and will probably only take 10 minutes on TeamViewer/Webex :)
