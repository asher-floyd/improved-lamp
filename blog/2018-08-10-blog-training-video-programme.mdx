We started making training videos about 12 months ago and feedback has been quite positive. At the last AGM, a suggestion came for a training programme aimed at new users to mXrap. The training videos are currently stored by app but a specific programme would help new users with a logical order for progressing through the training content.

We have made a new page for the [Training Programme](https://mxrap.com/mxrap-training-programme/) under the Training tab. The programme is structured in several user levels, from a basic introduction to General Analysis, moving through all the apps and finally to advanced app building tutorials. There are a few links to relevant blog posts and papers that will help users understand some of the analysis concepts. There are also exercise questions in each section for users to complete using their own data.
