We have made a couple of changes to the Paste Backfill Design application since the original release. See the [previous blog post](https://mxrap.com/2022/02/12/new-app-paste-backfill-design/) for the main details of the app.

Since the first release, we have modified the paste volume calculations to allow for multiple pouring locations and beach angles. This will be helpful for cases where there is an initial waste rock dump in the stope. The video below demonstrates a scenario where the stope is first filled with beach angle 37°, then filled with material at 3° beaching.

The multiple pouring locations can be used if the waste rock is dumped from a different place to the paste pouring. See video below.
