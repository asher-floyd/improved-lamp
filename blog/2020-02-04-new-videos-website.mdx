mXrap.com has a new training videos website!

{/* truncate */}

The new website has an improved interface and revamped training programme, along with some new videos (including event density isosurfaces and system design). The new login system allows us to show you which videos you've already watched.

To access the new site, go to [www.mxrap.com/mxvideos](http://www.mxrap.com/mxvideos) and log in with your Google account, Microsoft account or with any other email address. If you have any questions about the new videos website or anything else related to mXrap, email our support email address.
